## Key Features

### Multicell Calculations
Create independent solution cells to structure your work.
- Press the ⌘ (command) key to open a new calculation cell.
- Each cell evaluates independently while remaining accessible for later reuse.

### Structural Mathematics Input
Klator supports visually structured mathematics rather than plain text.
- Use / to create fractions.
- Use xⁿ to insert exponents.
- Tap any part of an expression to reposition the cursor precisely.

---

### Undo & Redo
Quickly correct mistakes without losing progress.
- ⎌ Undo reverts the last action.
- ⎏ Redo restores an undone action.

---

### Result Recall (ans)
Every calculation is automatically numbered.
- Each result is assigned an orange cell index on the left.
- Reuse results by typing ans followed by the cell number  
  Example: ans0
