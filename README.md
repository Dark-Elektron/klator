## Key Features

### Multicell Calculations
Create independent solution cells to structure your work.
- Press the ⌘ (command) key to open a new calculation cell.
- Each cell evaluates independently while remaining accessible for later reuse.

---

### Structural Mathematics Input
Klator supports visually structured mathematics rather than plain text.
- Use / to create fractions.
- Use xⁿ to insert exponents.
- Tap any part of an expression to reposition the cursor precisely.

---

### Undo & Redo
Quickly correct mistakes without losing progress.
- ⎌ Undo reverts the last action.
- ⎏ Redo restores an undone action.

---

### Result Recall (ans)
Every calculation is automatically numbered.
- Each result is assigned an orange cell index on the left.
- Reuse results by typing ans followed by the cell number  
  Example: ans0

---

### Equation Solver
Klator includes a built-in equation solver.
- Supports linear, quadratic, and simultaneous equations
- Handles up to three variables: x, y, z
- Enter equations naturally as written in mathematics

---

### Multiline Equation Solving
For systems of equations:
- Use ⌘ to start a new line for each equation
- Klator automatically detects the number of variables
- The solver determines how many equations are required

---

### Customisation
Tailor Klator to your preferences.
- Decimal precision control
- Theme selection
- Haptic feedback toggle

Access these options via the settings (gear) icon.
